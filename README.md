### Additional Instructions for macOS Users

Due to macOS security settings, you may encounter a warning because it is from an unidentified developer. Follow these steps:

**Open the Application Anyway**
1. Right-click (or Ctrl-click) on the application icon.
2. Choose 'Open' from the contextual menu to bring up the warning dialog.
3. Click 'Open' in the dialog. This allows you to run the application while bypassing the system's initial security settings.
